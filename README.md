# SST39SF010-FLASH-Programmer
Program FLASH EEPROMs from Scratch in 20 Minutes!

Build information for my DIY FLASH image reading and writing for SST39SF010. See my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXYQcMpUBT3aaQKfmAVJNow for more information.

EDIT: If you want to write images >128KB into SST39SF020 or SST39SF040 I now have included version 1.1 that can do that, too. prom.exe remains unchanges, but you will need to update for schematic and Arduino sketch.

Have fun! Slu4
