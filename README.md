# SST39SF0x0-FLASH-Programmer

Build information for my DIY SST39SF0x0 FLASH programmer. Program FLASH EEPROMs from Scratch in less than 20 minutes.
See my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXYQcMpUBT3aaQKfmAVJNow for more information.

Hardware Version 1.1
Software Version 2.1

Added a PCB version of the breadboard hardware.

Updated the software to version 2.1: Write any binary file <= 512KB with fully automatic data transmission and verification.
No need to edit file sizes in the Arduino sketch any more.

Have fun!
