# SST39SF0x0-FLASH-Programmer

Build information for my DIY SST39SF0x0 FLASH programmer. Program FLASH EEPROMs from Scratch in less than 20 minutes.
See my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXYQcMpUBT3aaQKfmAVJNow for more information.

Version: Hardware 1.1 / Software 2.1

NEW: I've included a PCB version (schematics and Gerber files) of the breadboard hardware and upgraded the software. Now you can write any file size <= 512KB with fully automated data transmission and verification. No need to edit file sizes in the Arduino sketch any more.

Have fun!
